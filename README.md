# Distributed Machine Learning
# GADMM
This notebook file is the primary implementation of one of the proposed distributed machine learning algorithms called Group Alternating Direct Method of Multipliers (GADMM). The number of users and iterations can be adjusted according to the requirements but it should be bear in mind that more users and iterations mean longer time taken to generate the results.
